# Hi, I'm Khalid

I’m a researcher, programmer, artist, and writer, currently diving into some tricky but fascinating topics:
- **Legal architectures** (and why societies need more robust governance blueprints)  
- **Governance entropy** (all the ways systems get messy over time)  
- **Decision boundaries and transitions** (how we handle those big “pivot points” in technology and policy)

## What I’m Doing Now

- **Compute Attribution in AI**  
  I’m developing frameworks that reconcile technical and legal definitions of “computational resource usage.” My aim is to make them both **meaningful** *and* **enforceable**—no small feat, but I’m excited by the challenge.

- **Reading, Writing, Thinking**  
  At the moment, I’m reading about how different fields (law, economics, and tech) can collaborate more effectively. If you’re also bridging multiple domains, I’d love to compare notes.

## Where I'm From

- I'm originally from Nairobi, Kenya, I graduated from the University of Minnesota, where I focused on **Politics, Philosophy, and Economics**.
