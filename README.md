## Hi, I'm Khalid ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a **researcher, programmer, artist, and writer** exploring intersections of law, AI, and governance.  

Currently, I'm focused on **compute attribution in AI systems**â€”developing frameworks that bridge technical and legal definitions of computational resource usage.  

Previously, I studied **politics, philosophy, and economics** at the University of Minnesota.  

I share what Iâ€™m reading, writing, and thinking about at [notkhalid.com](https://notkhalid.com).  

ðŸ’¬ Let's talk â†’
